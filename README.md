## 1. Idea

누구나 아이디어를 많이 가지고 있고 좋은 아이디어도 있다

하지만 그들중 다수는 정말 나쁘고

나쁜 것들은 문제에 집중하지 않기 때문에 꽤 나쁘다고 생각한다


ex) 배달앱, 금융앱 베끼기


실제론 해결하고 싶은 문제가 아니기 때문에 

우리가 해야할 일은 스스로 삶을 돌아보려고 노력하는 것

무엇이 짜증나고,

나의 일상에 무엇이 있고

내가 할 수 있는 것은 뭔지,

부족하거나 놓친 정보는 뭔지

(pieter levels의 nomard list, hoodmaps는 

자신이 진정으로 겪은 문제에서 탄생)

늘 문제를 찾고 해결하려고 노력했는데 돌아보니 그게 맞더라

스스로 해결하는 문제가 있을 때 우리는 실제로 그 문제에 대해 전문가이기 때문
( 경쟁 우위 )

누구나 경쟁력있는 약간의 틈새시장을 가지고 있다

---

문제는 우리 모두가 매우 비슷하다는 점

-> 우리 모두가 같은 문제를 안고 있기 때문에 모두 같은 생각을 갖기 시작한다는 것을 의미

-> 그럼 덜 동질적homogeneous 이기를 원한다

그럼 어떻게? -> 미친 짓을 시작해야 한다

뭔가 독창적인 것 뭐든지 -> 대중문화 대신 새로운 서브컬쳐를 찾아라?

비주류의 장점은 그게 금기되면 아무도 그걸 하지 않는다는 것 - > 다시 경쟁우위

거기에서 비즈니스나 앱 아이디어, 서비스 아이디어 등 뭐든 찾을 수 있지만

독창적이어야 하는 것이 중요하다

그렇지 않으면 다른 사람들이 만드는 것과 같은 일을 하는 거고 돈을 벌지 못할 것이다

---

아주 작은 것부터 시작해야 한다

크게 시작하는 것보단 틈새시장을 키워봐라

크게 시작 < grow 틈새시장

### 틈새시장

틈새시장은 정말 멋지다

100달러 프로덕트 -> 100만 달러를 위해 10000명의 사용자만 필요

굉장히 많은 고객이 필요한게 아니다

작은 틈새시장이 필요하다

---
### 아이디어 목록

아이디어 목록을 만들수도 있다

어떤 것이 유망하고 계속 나에게 돌아오는지 확인한다음 만들기 시작할 수 있다

그리고 이것을 추적하는 것이 좋다

trello같은 곳에서 할 일을 포스트잇으로 작성하세요

나중에 아이디어가 필요할 수 있으므로 적어두세요

실제로 실행하기 전에 머릿속에서 끓어오르는데 오랜 시간이 걸립니다

한가지 대부분의 사람들과 모순되는 조언 DIY 
- 다른 사람들과 함께 어울리지 마라..? 
- 사업가라면 기술 공동 창업자가 필요하지 않다
- just learn to code
- just do it yourself, and learn to design whatever
- do the basic yourself 기본을 직접 수행하게 되면
- 시간이 많이 절약됩니다. (진짜..? 반대 아닌가)

이 사람이 설명하는 집단 사고의 위험성과 문제점
- 과대평가
- 서로 들뜸
- 낙관적
- 엄격함의 부재 발생 가능성

(확실히 내가 아는 대단한 사람들은 스스로 굉장히 엄격해야하고 자신을 속이지 말아야하고, 이상을 위해 노력하는건지 별 도움안되는 일만 하는건지 확실히 구분해야하고 그게 굉장히 어려운 일이라고 하긴 했었다)

혼자 있게 된다면 대부분 불안하기 때문에 과대광고(hype)를 폐기하게 된다

---
### 경쟁

아무도 당신의 아이디어를 훔치지 않는다. 실행이 전부다

어쨌든 모든 사람은 같은 아이디어를 가지고 있다

실행은 그것을 독창적이고 독특하게 만든다

실제로 아이디어를 공유하는 것은 좋다

왜냐하면 실제로 무언가를 만들기 전에 이미 잠재 고객과 이야기를 나눌 수 있으니

아이디어를 공유하는데 만족하세요

## 2. Build

요약 : '배움은 생존이다'

많은 사람들이 코드를 배워야 합니다

부트 캠프나 코드 아카데미에 가야하는데

절대 추천하지 않습니다

왜냐하면 시간이 많이 걸리기 때문입니다

몇달, 몇년이 걸리고

이것이 코딩을 하는 좋은 방법이라고 생각하지 않습니다

제 생각에 약간의 사기 같습니다
(잃어버린 내 3년..)

'코딩은 스스로 배워야한다고 생각합니다' (i think you should learn to code yourself)

그냥 구글을 열고

i think you should just open google

and write how to make a website 

and that's how i learned it

내 주변의 대부분의 성공한 사람들이 그렇게 배웠고

the biggest thing in coding and in business  you can learn,
코딩과 비즈니스에서 배울 수 있는 가장 큰 것은

is learning how to learn 
바로 배우는 방법을 배우고,

and learning how to figure things out for yourself
스스로 문제를 해결하는 방법을 배우는 것입니다

이건 굉장히 실용적인 지식이고

기업가 정신에서 super super 중요합니다

실제로 어떻게 하는지 아는 것 vs 필요할 때마다 전화해서 '이거 어떻게 하지?' 라고 묻지 않는 것

아니면 책이나 그에 관한 내용을 찾지 못하거나

그냥 직접 해보세요. (just do it yourself, why not?)

모든 정보들이 인터넷에 있는 시대입니다

youtube, stackoverflow, google가 있기 때문에 쉽게 찾을 수 있습니다

다시말하지만 그건 '당신이 가질 수 있는 가장 중요한 기술'

배우는 법을 배우세요
(좀 배우고 싶다..)

만약 당신이 정말 고집이 세고 코드를 배우기 싫다 -> typeform으로 가세요 (노코드 툴, 코드 작성할 필요없이 양식만으로 작은 미니 스타트업을 만들 수 있는 사이트)

Carrd -> 코드 없이 정말 고급스러운 웹사이트 구축 가능

나는 좋은 코더가 아니었고 스프레드시트로 시작했다

so i learned just in time with google
(구글로 즉각 즉각 배웠다?)

배워야 할 때 배우고, 

문제가 생기면 구글에서 문제를 찾아서 알아냈다
(when the problem happend, i would go on google and just find it and figure it out)

이것들을 배우지 않는 것의 유일한 옵션은
(and because the only option of not learning it)

내 스타트업 전체가 실패하는 것이기 때문에

이는 매우 좋은 제약이다

정말로 만드는 법을 배워야 한다
you need to learn how to make the button align with the logo because everybody think it's ugly

배워야 하는 좋은 이유이기도 하다

몇년 또는 몇달 동안 스타트업을 구축하는 많은 사람들이 있습니다
예) '우리는 6개월 동안 열심히 해왔습니다, 고객이 없고 그리고 디자인도 완벽하고 아름답습니다'

that doesnt work

i would say, max one month for a prototype
(아 구글번역 생각보다 짜증나네.. 언제 이걸 일일히 다 하나, 원내용이랑 번역 내용이랑 엇갈리는게 사소하게 너무 많다)

it has to be a good prototype, though

but don't spend too much time working on something

because you need to 'validate' with launching
launching = validate

that's very important

---

## 🚀 Launch

launcing, very important

so you built some things

and now you wanna actually get users,

and i think this is the most important step in any startup

because if validates if the product

is actually useful or not,

and can be monetized and stuff.

So, very big platforms for launching startups

'Prouduct hunt', one of the biggest

it'll get you about 10,000 users 10,000 visits

i think about 10% maybe convert or something or less.

Tips for Product Hunt,

make sure just the whole item looks really good.

Add some animated .gif.

Make a really good slogan.

Ask your friends and stuff about the slogan for your startup.

A lot of the startup slogans are just super obtruse,

and i dont know what they actually mean.

so, make it very simple. very important for product hunt.

product hunt works in san francisco time, so the time's on pacific standard time

which means that you might have to stay  until midnight san francisco time,

and then you need to submit your product.

because otherwise, if you submit at like a little bit too late to compete with other startups

on product hunt for that day, and you wanna be high on the ranking.

it's very important.

also, jump on the comments when you're on Product Hunt.

talk with people.

don't be marketing, just be honest and say,

if this bugs or whatever, fix them immediately and be friendly.

be a human.

its very important.

Hacker News is another one is very critical

they can destroy your whole startup with their comments

here it's even more important

dont do marketing stuff.

be as frank and honest and personal as you can.

if you build a food delivery app, whatever,

say 'i built a food delivery app' and then say something unique or whatever.

make it original, but make it freindly.

no spamming.

dont use voting rings and stuff, no bolts, all that bullshit.

its only gonna go down, you know?

they'll see it.

Reddit is verry, gigantic big.

it's abou 100 times big than the sites before hacker news and product hunt.

reddit is the mainstraem launching platform right now,

i think it's becoming very quickly.

Reddit, again, also, they dont like spam.

they dont like marketing

they will remove your listing very quickly

important think about Reddit is you wanna submit to subreddits

so if you doing an app for horse management

you might wanna go in slash R slash horse,

and you wanna be very friendly "hey guys, i made this app about horses"

how to manage them "would you give feedback on it?"

and then if it gets up-voted, people will like it,

it will actually, that's a very good chance to go to the front page.

i did it twice

i did it with Nomad List

I did it with Hood Maps

the problem is, when you go to the front page,

when you get about page two or three, your server will die

because it cant handle traffic

its like literally thousands of people in the same second,

so you wanna make sure that your site stays up.

so, technical term, but make it static.

make it in XHTML instead of PHP or JS.

just make it static so it actually runs.

Load test it before, cause a lot of people

just dont get onto the front page when they might have if their server stayed up.

and this, again, hundres of thousands of users you'll get from this, 400,000, maybe,

half a million, it's .

horse forum, its very important. its very important

so if you make this horse manamement app,

you wanna also go in your niche.

so you wanna find websites specifically for your niche.

in this case, horses, and you submit it there.

same story, make it personal.

this is actually users that might convert the highest,

because it's very relevant to them.

they have horse stables or whatever, and they need your app.

so publish here.

questions about launching?

Q: do you have any procedure that you go through when you do a new startup,
or you just jump right into it

like, are you doing competitor analysis or

A: good, i sometimes do competitive analysis. like i check if the app already exists,
but the thing is, the fact that an app already exists doesn't mean you can't add to the market, right?

so many times, when an app doesn't exist is you wanna build,
it means there is no market for it.

so usually, there is an app that already exists,
but it's shit, and it doesn't have a lot of users,
and it's just broken and ugly, whatever,

'so you can just make a better one
that's what i did a lot of times.

there's a lot of competitors of mine who were just,
their site was just unusable,

but they were big sites before, but yeah,
so it's easy to, not even take them over.

but just like, yeah you'll get more traffic,
but yeah, i will usually dive right into it.

and im a little bit arrogant and naive.
so im like "i can do this better, i'll just do it"
and sometimes usually it doesn't work out.

but mostly, one out of 10 times it does,
and then you made something that's better

so being a little bit arrogant about it works, I think.

Q: i mean like, do you have a checklist, i guess of a lot of things that you would go through?

A: i will try and do product hunt, reddit, hacker news, all those websites on the same day cause you kinda want a constant traffic,

cause then it's like, this whole day's about your startup and everybody's talking about it

and it has this giant effect, like exponential,

but the checklist is pretty much,

its kinda tweet about it, share it on facebook, then submit it. just it's pretty obvious, i think

just, it's pretty obvous, i think

----

### Grow

when you've launched, of course you need to check your analytics, like if it actually worked.

if, you know, usually you see a drop off.

you see a spike of traffic when it launches,

then it goes down and down and down,

which is very normal

doesn't mean your site is not validated

but if and when, in a week,
literally everybody's gone,

then you might think that maybe it's not successful.

so you wanna try, maybe, don't stop, but whatever.

you wanna try and grow.

if actually the traffic's still there.

you wanna try and grow it.

and what i really hate these days

and it's also of events in Dojo, is there's a lot of talk about

non-organic growth, and i think just doesn't work.

there's a lot of talk about Instagram bots.

I tried them too, last week.

Didn't work.

There's a Twitter follow / unfollow bots, like bots,

spamming by an E-mail list,
all this fucking dodgy

shady gray stuff or black hat stuff

and i hate it so much that every time.

In Dojo, I think every week I'll be in some heavy discussion

or at some coffee shop with somebody.

what you're doing is not good.

don't do it.

but, i dont wanna be moral night,

so i should shut up as well, but the thing is

this is how. non-organic growth looks.

it's a very ugly cow.

it's not good.

and look how beautiful the next cow looks.

this is organic growth, which means

people actually really like your website.

they're not there because of bots, or ads as well.

Ads are ethical, but i dont like ads.

like who of us has ad-blockers?

so why do we have ad-blockers but we're still buying ads at Fackbook and Google?

it's kinda morally ridiculous

i dont believe that ads will be the future,

so all the ads, they give you

let's say they give you a spike of 10,000 users and signups,

but when you stop buying these ads,

usually it slowly just fades out

And I see it a lot with venture capital-based startups

and i think venture capital-based start-ups are a lot like this,

cause it's all fake growth.

it's all a bold growth or paid traffic,

and i dont really think it works.

it stops working when the money stops, right?

then you usually just fall off.

and then you didn't really actually build something useful.

Organic growth is much cooler,

because it's much more hard to get,

but when you get it, it means you validated the product you built,

so you actually have people using it,

and actually people loving it.

and if you dont get traffic, it means your product's just not good enough.

so it's the ultimate teset of, is my product good or not?

should i tweak it,

should i build another product,

a new thing, whatever, to have organic.

And if you have all this paid traffic in there,

okay, it's kinda hard to see.

if people actually really like your product, or if it's just paid traffic.

Very important, what I do, to kinda get this growing.

I wanna build with my users.

So every site or every app I have has this title feedback box, and it just sounds like,

hey do you have feedback? "tell me, be nice"

cause people can be really angry in this feeback nox,

so i had to ask, be nice, and now they're really nice to me,

so it actually worked. 

if this box, like this,

the images are not loaading,

you can write, " Hey your images are broken."

But also there's a lot of feature requests.

Every week, I'll add a feature, or i'll change a feature

somebody just says is wrong

this week, i think i moved the search box on Nomad List

to the right because somebody said it looked ugly,

so, yeah, and them they're happy and they're involved

in the process, so building. i think it's called co-creating.

building with users is amazing because they become Ambassadors

Ambassadors of your products,

so they will tell, " Hey, I sent Pieter this message" about the search box,

and he actually changed it.

i love it you should use Nomad List, too.

so, it's very positive effect you have,

and users are really smart.

you shouldnt always listen to everything they say

but you should definitely consider it,

what they're saying.

A more beautiful feedback box, of course,

Intercom, used by most startups,

this works as well. it works very well

it's padi, though, so a little annoying.

very important to add on your website or app

is some kinda thing so you can re-engage users later.

so you launch with 10,000 users on Hacker News

or Product Hunt,

but then after that day, those 10,000 people are gone.

so how do you contact them again?

so you wanna re-engage.

so, capture their E-mail with, i dont know,

somewhere like this, send me a message

when you have special food discounts in my area, or whatever.

what i did with remote OK was,

the remote jobs website,

I would have daily job alerts that people can subscribe to.

Nomand List has a newletter, so that kinda stuff.

so you can E-mail people later.

Don't spa people, you know?

Again, just be sparing using these E-mail addresses,

cause you guys know how annoying

it is to have annoying E-mails

flooding your inbox.

Very important and very trendy,

and if you do this, you will be

so far ahead of everybody else.

Build your startup in public.

So this guy is friend of mine,

kinda friend, acquaintance, not really acquaintance.

Hardly know.

But, it's Drew Wilson who once Tweeted.

he's really cool, and he built Plasso,

this payment startup, but he build a lot of it in public,

and he just live streams.

so he's just sitting there.

it's a little boring, but also kinda fun,

because he plays music and stuff,

and you can see his code, so you can see the product

being built right there in front of you

and that's super cool.

and the cool thing is, nobody else is doing that.

i did it with Hood Maps.

I hardly know anybody who's doing it.

and it gives you so much attention and press,

so definitely try this.

takes guts, but also streaming, it makes you very productive.

100 people were watching me,

and i never coded as fast,

cause i was just so nervous and stuff, so it works.

Another one to keep growing is to keep launching,

so dont launch your startup once.

launch a feature as well, and launch to the press again

and just keep doing it eery two or three months.

you wanna keep getting into the press

and keep getting into these websites.

i dont think you can launch it in Product Hunt every two months

but you can launch every year.

every big version number you have, or every change you can do, you can launch again,

and that's very important, cause you wanna stay in people's minds.

---

## Monetize

this is very important too.

Monetizing.

you aren't running a charity, you're running a business.

if people won't give you money for your product,

you have an existential crisis on your hands,

and that's very important.

And I see so many startups just dont make money,

and it's like, how do you pay your rent?

just, i don know.

and that's just not the way to do it.

it's very importanat to make money,

because you need to pay your bills,

and i would say within three months,

i would say within two months, maybe,

get the first dollar in.

maybe even during lanch day, get the dollars running,

cause otherwise, again you didn't validate.

you made a nice startu but it's not making money,

so it's not really validated as a product, and that's a big problem.

focus on money, and focusing money is very difficult for us.

I'm Dutch, so especially for Dutch people,

they're traders historically,

but they're very weird about money.

you're not really allowed to make money.

this is a typical, i wrote it myself,

but this typical example E-mail of the stuff I would get

when i started charging money.

so, i'll read for you.

this is an E-mail by grumpycat2019.

'i cant believe what just happened. so anywaym i was feeding my cat,
and then i was trying to find an app,
so i can schedule my social media post.
i really put too much time into scheduling, so i need this app.
so i found this app called media scheduler 2000
okay so i sign up, and what the hell
i have to pay $25 a month for it?
who does the maker of this app think?
what a capitalist. he's just making easy money off the back of others.
this should be free. its always these big companies trying to make money off the little people.

Even gamil's free. don't support this app. The maker's evil, one one'

But really, this is a typical E-mail i get.
It's absolutely ridiculous.

they think you're a big company, but you're just you and your labtop
and trying to just pay your bills and buy a coffee, 

and this is so, this happens so much, especially in Reddit.
Like people really hate when you chaarge moeny for something,

but you should charge money for something,
and just ignore these people.

and there's always a free alternative of your app that's worse, 
but you're not competing with them.

you're competing in the premium. with actually charging money.
A very good example of how to charge and validate at the same time is Buffer
and they pioneered this whole thing.

They didn't even launch a product yet,
but they just put up a landing page with a plans and pricing button,

and if you clicked it, this is social media scheduling as well,
you would get an E-mail box,

and you could sign to get updated
if the app actally launched.

and this was amazing, cause this is literally just validating how many people will click on this?

how many people add their e-mail?
okay, so now we have a list of 10,000 people
that might actually wanna pay for it,

because they clicked pricing,
so they actually wanna maybe pay for it.

i did this idea even worse, or even bigger.

i made whole payment button with a fake stripe box
where you enter your credit cards

for a feature you wanna use, and then after paying,
they wouldn't be actually be paying.

I said, you didn't actually pay.
this was a fake stripe payment box, but now i know

that you would pay if i built the actual feature.
but i didnt actually build the feature yet.

so, that's again, validating a feature before you build it,
if actually people pay for it.

but buy buttons on everything.
this is the most improtant slide of my presentation.

you wanna check what people pay for in your product,
so every feature, put a pay ball on it to see what happens,

and then starat, if nobody pays for it, make it free,
but limit your app as well.

see what people pay for again. super important
A few business models here that you can apply.

A lot of websites you know and startups,
they don't actually make money off their main product.

they make money off their by-line product, kind of, their main product.
So this is Nomad List.

This website doesn't make any money.
this is all free data. you can filter cities in the whole world.

Nobody pays money for this, but this is like a social media,

or like a social network for travelers,

which also Nomad List, which 8000 people pay money for

;redacted slides due to competitive threats from dribble's owner'
Dribble, you guys, a lot of designers here know dribble?

a design website. it;s free to post your designs on Dribble,

and nobody pays money for this, but there's a job site.

that business people business pay for to post jobs.

and they pay a lot for it.

i think $299 for 30 days

so you can use your main site to be free. liek Freemium

and then have side things.

also, sponsorships are good.

when i launched Nomad List, I got an E-mail

within the first day by Matt Mullenweg,

the founder of WordPress, who had liked the website,

and he said, "Can we sponsor it?"

and i was like "Sure, I'll add a little banner"

and then automatic, wordpress are hiring.

and he paid me a few thousand dollars a month for it,

and it still pays, so yeah

that's a very good sponsorship model you can do as well.

it's just, it's very hard to get sponsorships.

going outbound, like E-mailing companies for it is very hard.

you wanna be so cool as a product, maybe,

and be lucky to, a cool company wants to help you and provide you,

so you can keep developing on the website.

and this money helped a lot, 

because in the beginning i wasn't making a lot of money,

so it has helped me continue developing the website.

A more cool modern model that you might now is patreon

where you just simply ask your users to pay moeny,

not even for a specific feature,

but just for supporting you as a maker,

and i just saw this week on twitter

a guy called sindre sorhus, who does a lot of open source development,

he just asked like,

"Hey, do you wanna give me money for my open source work the last few years? i've been working for free"

and i think he got a few thousand dollars.

this is my friends abroad in Japan.

a japanese youtuber, british guy in japan,
and he makes $3,000 a month from 800 people paying him.

a few dollars a month, and it's actually a sustainable model to make money these days, and why not?

overcast,, a podcast app for IOS, does the same thing.
they dont have premium features anymore.

they just have a patreon part where you can literally just say,
"Okay, i'll pay $12 cause i love the app"

and you dont even get anything.
you just, you're a supporter and i think 400 people a day,
or something, they're Patreons, so it's a lot of money.

very important about monetization.

you know, i see a lot of people, i did the same thing.
i see a lot of people charge $50 once to unlock a feature

or use your product, but it's not recurring revenue,
and recutting revenue is quite important,

because, as you can see in this chart,
if you have a single payment of $75 and the company,

you can't see it, but it says sales growth by 25% a year,
which is kinda okay growth, you know,

year one, you make $75,000 on both.
in year five, when you have a single payment by a user,

you make $ 183000 and with a subscription,
you make alomost $2000000 a year,
because subscriptions keep going, and they keep growing with more and more subscriptions,
so it's exponential kinda growth, and it's just a lot of money.

and of course, you'll have churn, too.
you'll have people canceling your subscriptions,

but still, in the end, it's kinda positive.
only thing is, subscriptions are annoying for users.

i hate getting another bill of some service i signed up
a few years ago, like fuck, i was still paying for that.
i dont even use it. that might be annoying.

--

## Automate

this is a also really cool part. automating.
so if you have this whole business running now, you make money, and you kinda

you kinda get sick of the business.
like, i get sick of startups after one or two years or whatever.

i like doing new stuff.
i hate doing the same shit all over, over and over and again.

so you can get robots to work for you.
you can hire people, but humans are difficult.

Robots are much easier and more efficient, i think.
so automating.

so this is my server right now.
i made a screenshot a few hours ago.

in the top, you can see, it's blocked,
but it's 187 robots are running now.

that's parallel processes, and they're doing something for my site.
they're getting the weather for the cities on Nomad List.

they're getting job posts for Remote OK.
They're processing refunds for users.

Both sites are 100% automated,
and these robots keep everything running.

this is my scheduled cron jobs, which means,
it's tech lingo for scheduled programs, these robots.

all these things are things that i need to do hourly or daily or weekly.
this is my whole business, is all these lines.

this is all the robots running everything and for me, it's really cool.

it just looks really cool that i have this server somewhere in San Francisco, and it just does all this stuff.

and i have anywhere from 180 to 700 robots running,
working for me 24/7,

and they can scale up and scale down whenever they want.
when they need more people, they just hire more people.

within seconds, more robots.
it's just, the magnitude of this is like, it's hard to explain, but it's
it means that you can run entire businesses now with robots,

with scripts doing stuff for you,
and this means that you can hire people but then you can't really fire them,

cause it's hard with labor laws.
Humans get sick, all this stuff.

and i know it sucks, but this is the reality.
Robots are to bee honest, jost more efficient at a lot of stuff.

this for example, how to monitor robots.
so what's the role for the human then left in his little black box of a business you built?

well, i think it's very important to have one human hired full time to manage all these robots

when you've automated everything, so they can check if your sever's down or not.

otherwise, you're still 24/7 working on this business i've woken up so many times, it's 4 a.m,

just check my website, and it's down,
and then i have to do all this stuff,

and then i'm awake for three hours cause the server crashed.
you wanna have a guy or girl or whatever on there, on standby.

get alerts when a server's down and when the robots are not doing their work.

## Exit

exit is very important

i've never done it, buut selling your business. i've got proposals to sell my business, but im not happy yet with the price.

very important to just finally get on with it and start living i guess.
the price of an exit is usually something like this.

so, let's say you have 25% growth.
you have $100,000. usually you can ask $500,000.

if you have higher growth, you can ask even a million dollars
for $100,000 a year business.

this is very important. so that's why you see all these startups.
they think about their growth rates so much

cause they want the growth rate for the selling price.
it's very important.

i think i would sell for something like four or five revenue multiple or something,

cause my growth rate is okay. it's kinda stable.
it's slowly growing.

and also, there's a lot of psychological things with selling,
like if you wanna sell your company, maybe.

your company's your baby.
if i sell, maybe i get depressed, so think about that stuff.
see, that's the whole loop.

so,
1. you have an idea
2. you solve your own problem
3. you build it
4. then you launch it
5. you grow it organically, very important. (that's my opinion)
6. monetize it
7. automate it
8. exit
9. and then you do it again

and this is like a little ecosystem and pattern i found after a few years.
thanks for listening.

Q: did you finish the 12 startups in the year?
A: No, i did about seven, because nomad list was taking off, and i had a decision. 

i could either continue, finishing startups, which is very important for me or I could do Nomad List and make it big, 

and i think if i would have continued making new projects every month for another five times, then i'm afraid nomad list wouldn't be big. 

it would have just, cause it took like hardcore effort to keep this growth going, and i had to keep adding features, 

and i think otherwise, it would be a passe, one-day fly thing, so unfortunately i didn't finish

but im still thinking, today i was checking the black ball,
it was like 2014, and i thought,

it'd be cool to do those five at some point in five months,
but just to resolve it for myself spiritually.

Q : How do you deal with all the legal stuff? where do you set your companies up and taxes.. how do you deal with all that?
like when you're setting up loads of new companies all the time as well.
A : good. what you can do, you can have one company the holding company and actually everything you do is just a project. 

so it's called a startup, called a business, but you can just do it in-house.

and you can even spin things off. and i think it's fiscally, in some countries.

more beneficial to do the separate entities, but in a case of Holland, it's really annoying to start LLC or (speaking in foreign language) we call it.

It costs like $5,000 in bookkeeping fees, so i was just like
"Okay, i'll just do it on my own little company"

so i just have one company and that's it
and that's what i have everything in.

so it works fine, and it kinda is like,
it works with my lean, simple approach.

i dont like spending too much time in al this difficult stuff, tax stuff, fiscals.

i want it to be legal, but that's it.
but i think even if you have a company,

you can spin off parts of it legally, so why not?

Q: are you the only one adding features or do you have people for that? how do you handle that?

A: no, it's just me. all the websites. just me.
so it's a lot of work, but then again it's also not a lot of work.

it's a lot of night here at Dojo as Michae knows, cause he always watched the security cameras at night.

Like we buy nine coffees and then we come here.
Nine lattes, and we sit with Andre and everybody,

we sit there in the Air-con room at night,
an then we ship loads of features,

but usually these are cycles. we play techno music.
and we dance on the table.

but it goes in cycles, so it's a lot of hard work
for many days or weeks, and then

now it's pretty much like very little work.
so it's just running.

i think you can keep things running for very long,
but then it slowly will get dusty

merely because the time changes.
people will want diffrent design.

there's different trends, right?
or diffrenet, i dont know even travel trends,

so you wanna slowly maybe change the website.
but my idea now for 2018 was to kind of keep it running and live a little bit more

and relax a little bit more, cause the last four years was like a whirlwind of hardcore working, traveling,
and doing all this stuff, and yeah.

it's very intense if you do everything yourself like press stuff.
like people attack you in the press.

Weird shit.

but it's very intense, so maybe relax more.

Q : over the years, what do you think top 3 mistakes that you've done that you could have avoided?
A: i think listening to yourself, to you intuition is much more important. than i thought.

i was trusting always on the internet so much, like TechCrunch and shit, like i started reading TechCrunch like 2011, and i thought that was the way to build a startup.

like, you raise 23 million dollars, and you hire a team
and get a office and stuff, and it didnt turn out to be for me, anyway, the thing to do.

and every time, i'm really stubborn, but every time
i think something is the way to do it,

it turns out to be the way to do it for me, just because i force it kinda,
and so trusting yourself and your intuition is super important.

you're not wrong, usually. the time is wrong, you're not wrong.
like a lot of people here, we're nomads, and this is a very early adopter scene.

so you're already an early adopter,
so it means i think you know things a little bit better that the common people, or, that sounds really bad,

like normal people, normies.

but it means that, if you would never trust yourself, you wouldn't even be here, so you wanna trust yourself very important.

that's the most important thing.

other mistakes.. just be nicer. be nice in anything.
twitter, it's a hell hole.

i know a lot of you people aren't on Twitter.
I'm on Twitter a lot the tech scene is on Twitter.

so many haters, especially when things are going well.
first nobody knows you, and then things are going well,
and people just start hating on you for no reason.

so don't engage with haters. ignore them.
they're just angry. and i dont know a third a mistake 

Q: How did you monetize the digital nomads
A: website, Nomad List, it's a membership site mostly, so you can join.
like i sai you can use everything on the website. it's like a read-only website, so there's social profiles. of where i traveld and stuff.
and then i can see where somebody else is traveling.

but if you actually wanna have your own profile, you need to sign up,
you login with Facebook, and then you have to pay $1 a day or $99 a year, i think

and then you can use all the features.
so it's kinda like teasing.

like you show the features, but then, if people wanna interact, they can't . they have to pay

it wasn't like that from the start, no.

well, the start was only a city list.
that was it.

but, actually this is a good story
the reason i started charging money
was because i was getting spammers.

i had this slack chat for nomads,
and it started filling up.

within a month, there was a thousand people on there.
and we started getting these internet marketing people,

and i thinkg if you're on facebook you know very well.
these people, they're also in these Bali groups.

they're like "Hey guys, im selling my courses, so i'm getting new people on" and stuff,

and it was just really annoying that every body was selling their own shit all the time.

so, i was so annoyed, so i was like, well you know you're obviously selling something

so pay for it, so $5

i got a typeform for $5 and started charging,
and then it slowed down a little bit, the spammers,

but then it started growing more,
and then, again, the same thing, all these spammers.

So $24, okay $50, $100, and they kept paying,
so it was kinda like accidentally,

i had a business model where people actually paid for Xs,
and also, the room spam, there's hardly any spam now.

accident.

Q: you said about coding? dont do any boot camp. any kind of-
A: just my personal opinion

Q: that's okay, but what would you recommend to start learning? would you do PHP?
A: I google

Q: I know, but the language.
A: i dont think it matters

Q: for someone that don't know anything, should just go and Google, and you search
A: i used PHP and javascript and css, all plain, vanilla.
but i dont think it matters.

i think all these javascript frameworks are very difficult.
and obtruse and bullshit, but theoretically, you should just google and then figure it out for yourself,

even which language you should figure out for yourself,
because figuring out for yourself is the main skill you need.
right. that's the point

Q: and so once you figure it out by yourself, if there are some boot camps available that are faster, obviously, how many times--

A: it's not faster.

Q: so you took less than two months or three months to learn?
A: no, i could do basic WordPress PHP stuff.
and then, you know i could make a table of cities, so i did that.
so i copied the stuff from the google sheet to a table.
then i had nomad List, and i launched it.

and then i was like, okay, how do i make this city.
pop up open with more data? so i was like, 
okay, how to hide stuff on webpage,

and enter, and then fuck, this is bullshit.
JQuery, what the fuck?
okay, JQuery doesn't work.

Days of this pain, this suffering.
which is, this suffering is essential to getting anywhere in life, as you know,

any skill, so 
Just google any little question.
because if you see coders here,
i would suggest go in Dojo on a day,

and look around for rural developers.
see what they're actually doing.

they're half the time in this coding screen.
black with colors, half the time.
they're googling everything.

everyday. i dont know what to do with this fucking code.
and i have to google it, and then im on stack overflow.
i'm like this looks horrible. copy, paste.
okay, wow. it works. this is amazing.
and that's literally my day.

Q: but if you dont understand why it works

A: no, it doesn't matter
i think the coders are half, half the codes the codes they don't understand. i didnt understand most, though.

im not joking. im serious.
really, just google

it's weird, i dont know.

im just saying my opinion, my perspective.
like i said, your mileage may vary.

maybe there's different styles, i dont know.
i dont think there's different styles to be honest
but that's my opinion.

Q: when you did the fake Stripe checkout stuff, did you get any negative feedback to that, when you fake the features, and you fake the

A: no, i dont think so. i didn't use Stripe logo.
i just like a payment box. but it was definitely a little bit brutal.
like crazy thing to do, but i didn't save any credit card data, so it's.
sorry, i didnt. i wrote that.
i didnt save your credit card data. this is bullshit.
this is just a test if you actually would pay for the feature

Q: what did people respond to that?

A: Nothing, i just got their E-mail. i dont know what they respond.
i just got their E-mail. then i sent them an E-mail, and they paid for the real feature

dont be shy. cause otherwise i become really shy.

Q: have you ever made something and then had this feeling that it's crap?

A: yeah, everyday

Q: before and after?

A: no, still, so this guy, Bettra Siska, this week,
he was whining about Nomad List being the most ugly website he's ever seen, and i got so triggered.
i started overheating in the coffee shop.
he helped me align everything properly, like designer, and now he's like, it looks good.

so, yeah, it's always, that's art, you know?
i think it's very similar to art. it's never.

the moment you made it, you hate it, so.

Q: True, absolutely, has happened to me lots of times
A: Yeah, it's absolutely normal.

you can just keep making new stuff. that's what artists do.
just ship more startups.

but you know the thing is, when it makes money,
it kinda like, it's really horrible website, but it makes money,

so some idiots might like it, you know?
you might think that.

not really, but kinda.
but you're always further than your audience, right
like everythin i'm telling now,
maybe i hardly dont even believe in it anymore.

it's just you're always ahead.
cause you're the maker.

you're not the consumer of the work, so, normal

Q: when youre doing big launches on Product Hunt or Reddit and you see this huge spike of new users, 

how do you know, especially when you get the big drop off afterwards, 

how do you know at what point to stop working on the website, or what data do you look at since you've built a lot of these?

you know, you've launched a lot of startups.
at what data do you look at to know whether to continue?

A: I think it's kinda like a feeling now so,
you want daily people kinda to come back. i dont know how much.
it's kinda hard to say, right?

but a good thing to track is press mentions.
so what i have, i have a google bookmark where it's like past 24 hours or past week
and i have in quotation marks, the name of my product like Hood Maps or Nomad List or whatever.

you can do Nomad List in quitation marks or Hood Maps in quotation marks last 24 hours, and i just have it as a bookmark

so sometimes i click and im like, 'what are people talking, are they talking about my app or are they not? whats happening?'

and tracking that and seeing nobody talk about your app
at all after it was on Product hunt?

that might be a little difficult, that might mean that it's not important.
Andre just launched or is working on.

what is Dark Mode List, a website where you can see which apps have dark modes,

and that's been getting press mentions all over the place now, so that's kinda like, that validates it a little bit.

like he can continue working on it.
and if everybody's like, this is really bullshit.

why should i write about it as press?
then, okay maybe skip it.

although press is definitely getting less and less relevant,
but yeah, people talking about it is always good.

and it's about if you how far do you wanna continue with it, you know?
is it just a gimmick app, or is it a real app.

you really believe in, then you might wanna give it a few more weeks, but i would not give it a few more months.
it's very risky. you're wasting your time.
just do new stuff, in my opinion, so.

Q: Any features on your sites that you regret not charging for
or charging too late, early, or?

A: i dont know i think Nomad List, it's so much data now and so valuable, and it sounds really arrogant, 

but it's a really it's kinda like a really useful travel planner now to find destinations to go and to find how it is there. 

and i think it would be obvious to slowly charge a little bit mroe for premium stuff. 

maybe how many filters you can use or whatever like limits, use just a little bit, but then again,

i also dont wanna do that because it annoys people and i wanna be the main travel search website kinda that's out there for nomads, 

so yeah, i think i could have charged more for that, like just a little Stripe box.

Okay, just pay $10 to use all the features, you know?
doesn't have to be like a membership.

cause a lot of people say.
the main free websites very useful.

the community website, i really dont care about cause i dont wanna make friends. i dont care, i have enough friends or something.

so that means you lose. im missing out on a lot of money, with giving something for free, and i see with a lot of people, they give away everything for free, and you probably shouldn't.

you should probably limit from the beginning because it's hard to start limiting features now.

now everybody will become angry, than do it from the start

Q: so let's say that maybe you have some other kind of business, some other product or something else,
and you want something like Product Hunt, and there's nothing for it, but essentially, you wanna validate your idea.

how would you go about doing that or what would be kind of a structure that you would have, or via somebody else.
say they have a product. say they're shipping some kind of thing on somewhere else.

what would you do or tell them to do?

A: i dont completly understand. so you have a product that doesn't fit Product Hunt?

Q: Yeah, so part of your success, a great deal, as i understand it is that you're have this community where you can easily go, and you can validate your product.

you know, you take Nomad List to Product Hunt. Everybody likes it.
What would you suggest, say for example, if there wasn't a Product Hunt for that.

A: i think you need to go to your horse forum, your niche forums or niche websites. Reddit has a lot of niches. subreddits with niches.

you can do a fairly physical thing.
Like, there's a guy called Patrick Mckenzie,

Patio11, who's a big inspiration of me, and he would go into hair salons and just start selling his.

he had like an app called Appointment Reminder where he would get an SMS message an hour before you had your hairdressing appointment or something,

so he would go into barber shops, and just say "Hey, i have this app"
And they're like "Yeah, of course we want this" "This is amazing"
"It will save us so much time and people forgetting their hair appointments"

so, physically even going to your customers.
where are your customers?
where are your users?

even that you can do if there's no websites, you know?
but you need to think about where are your users?
how can you get to them?

Q: Have you ever come up with, are all your ideas original or have you ever looked at a website and thought, or an idea and thought, this is garbage. i can do it better? and then executed on it.

A: it's mostly, again, it's like i've tried to solve problems always, so i would find websites that solve problems, but partly.
Like Nomad List is a lot of cost of living data.

There's Numbeo, there's Expatistan, which are now my competitors.
They were doing that, but they didnt give me filter buttons and they didnt give me,

it wasn't targeted nomads. they had no idea about nomads, so
there's always websites that are already doing it

but i think you have to fundamentally think about your problem.
Go from first principles.

what's your problem that you wanna solve here,
and that's gonna make the whole journey easier.

Q: do you not ever think that you've expanded so much that investing in PPC or getting a team or social media manager, then you could grow a lot more,

or is it if you just stay as one person, other businesses might overtake you?

A: So i had a social media media manager a little bit who buffered.
She buffered Tweets and Facebook posts and stuff,
and it was okay

it was very nice work, but
i think it's a very weird time now where actually, everybody's doing all the social media posting stuff, and i think we're very tired of content and stuff and i think we're very tired of content and stuff

and i think a lot of people just want an app that just does something specifically, functionally.

like, for example, no one is like, where do i go now?
filters, okay, there i go.

and a lot of these, a lot of solutions for problems
are apps,  or they're a solver of things that you can easily that are hard to make, but you can automate, and a lot of i see less and less perspective of future in stuff that's human which sounds fucking autistic, 

but it's just, it's kinda like how it is.
the future is robotic and automation.

and i think it's easier to make money like that with just software
and anything that involves

a ring of humans around it is hard.
i think actually it's harder to scale, but i dont completely know the right answer,

but i think it's harder to scale. cause software just scales.
cause software just scales.

Literally, now i have maybe 40 people on my website, generally, at this moment.

if it's on Reddit, i'll have 4,000
and nothing changes you know?

and i dont need to hire people, and to me that's amazing

Q: that's the idea that we're moving towards the useless revolution where everyone becomes useless.

A: I think so. not even a joke. it's serious. basic income. 
Free money for everybody.
cause again, it sounds so fucked up, but im annoying too, as a human.

Most the times i dont even wanna work.
i need to drink two lattes to even get some codes on the paper, and this robot just runs, and it doesn't sleep.

so i think definitely,

dont be scared of it, but embrace it.
start coding.

very important to code, sorry again. it's so important.
if you're not coding, you're gonna be unemployed, maybe,
probably, yes.

so thank you for listening and thank you for comming,
and if you have questions,
after, private one-on-one, we can also talk here.

Thanks so much guys
